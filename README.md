# Heic To Jpeg Converter

Got frustrated when I needed to download photos from my iPhone and they were in HEIC format. Most applications that convert HEIC to JPG on windows are way too bloated.

This application adds a context menu to windows; when right clicking on one (or more) HEIC files, you can easily convert to JPG.

## How to use
1. Download the exe from the Assets section of the [latest release](https://github.com/3vcloud/HeicToJpegConverter/releases).
2. Run the downloaded application
3. Click "Install Context" to add an extra option to the context menu of HEIC files in windows.
4. Right click on any HEIC file and click "Convert to JPEG"
